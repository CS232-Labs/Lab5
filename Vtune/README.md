# Intel Vtune Assignment

## Problem Statement
- Perform non-algorithmic optimisations i.e The provided flowchart must be followed
- Don't change code in areas marked appropriately by comments

### Part1

### Part2

#### Intro
You have to optimise the provided [password cracking c code](link_to_code). You are provided with a [Makefile](link_to_makefile) which you're to use(`make run`) to generate the executable on which you'll perform your analysis using Vtune. Note that you must not modify the Makefile.
Can change the number of iterations
Output format
What is supposed to increase?
Idea to reduce analysis jitter (for analysing your result when running on your terminal)
